# Howdy! Welcome To My `from-kelas-terbuka` Branch

This branch contains my Python OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) tutorials from [kelas terbuka](www.youtube.com/@KelasTerbuka). 

# Reference

I borrowed the Python OOP tutorials from kelas terbuka (also known as "Faqihza Mukhlish"). Kelas terbuka means "public class", which means it is opened for everyone who is interested in studying programming. For more comprehensive informations of kelas terbuka, please kindly go to his profile YouTube channel.

In addition, I have also incorporated additional information from outside sources, such as other YouTube channels, Python documentations, chatbots, and online books to provide more comprehensive understanding of each of the Python OOP tutorials topic.

# Tutorial Summary

## 1. Pendahuluan Object-Oriented Programming

As I mentioned on the main branch, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm based on the concept of wrapping pieces of **data** (attributes) and **behaviour** (methods) into speical bundles called objects, which are constructed from a set of "blueprints" defined by a programmer called classes.

## 2. Constructor

The `__init__()` method is a [special method](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-special-method) that is automatically called when an object (instance) of a class is created. Its primary purpose is to initalize the instance's attribute values implicitly through the `self` parameter. (In Python, `self` is not a keyword, rather it is just a naming conventation. It is also used to refer to an instance of a class, and behind the scences, Python automatically passes the instance as for the first argument.)

## 3. Class Dan Instance Variables

Class variables are variables that are shared across all instances of a class, whereas instance variables are variables that are unique to each instance of a class.

## 4. Instance Methods

Instance methods are methods whose first parameter is `self`. This parameter must be used because instance methods are bound to the object of a class. These methods are also used to either access or modify the object's attributes.
