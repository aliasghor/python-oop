# Howdy! Welcome To My `from-kelas-terbuka` Branch

This branch contains my Python OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) tutorials from [kelas terbuka](www.youtube.com/@KelasTerbuka). 

# References

I borrowed the Python OOP tutorials from kelas terbuka (also known as "Faqihza Mukhlish"). Kelas terbuka means "public class", which means it is opened for everyone who is interested in studying programming. For more comprehensive informations of kelas terbuka, please kindly go to his profile YouTube channel.

In spite of I watched his Python OOP tutorials, I have also incorporated additional information from outside sources, such as other YouTube channels, Python documentations, chatbots, and online books to provide more comprehensive understanding of each of the Python OOP tutorials topic.

# Tutorial Summary

## 1. Pendahuluan Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm based on the concept of wrapping pieces of **data** (attributes) and **behaviour** (methods) into speical bundles called objects, which are constructed from a set of "blueprints" defined by a programmer called classes.

## 2. Constructor

The `__init__()` method is special method that is automatically called when an object (instance) of a class is created. Its primary purpose is used to initalize the object's attribute value through the `self` parameter. (`self` parameter is a mandatory parameter for all instance and special methods because, behind the scences, Python automatically passes the objects as for the first argument.)

## 3. Class Dan Instance Variables
Class variables are variables that are shared across all instances of a class, whereas instance variables are variables that are unique to each instance of a class.
